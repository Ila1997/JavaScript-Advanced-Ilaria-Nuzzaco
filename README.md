# *About the project:*
This is a simple website, google style, created mostly with Javascript.

The website uses a Teleport service, and it allows the user to search a city and learn useful facts about it.

You can use it both from laptop and mobile.

*I loved this project because I was able to put as the background image a photo I took of the mesmerizing Burano, a Venice's Island.*
